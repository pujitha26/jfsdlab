Develop a Spring Boot application to insert new Order using POST request with JPA on an Order entity class. The Order class should include properties such as Order ID, Product Name, Quantity, Order Date, and Customer Name. The Order ID MUST be provided manually while adding the data and must not be null, with unique constraints applied accordingly.
